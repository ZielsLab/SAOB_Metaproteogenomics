# Metabolic Networks of Acetate-Oxidizing Bioreactor Communities

Repository for code, SLURM executables, and workflows for investigating the metabolic networks of acetate oxidizing microbial communities in lab-scale anaerobic enrichment bioreactors. Applying stable-isotope informed genome-resolved metagenomics and metaproteomics to understand the dynamics and functional guilds of microorganisms producing methane through the syntrophic-acetate oxidation pathway.
