# Metabolic Networks of Syntrophic Acetate-Oxidizing Bioreactor Communities

Repository for code, SLURM executables, and workflows for investigating the metabolic networks of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing (SAO) microbial communities in lab-scale anaerobic enrichment bioreactors. Applying genome-resolved metagenomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, and stable-isotope probing to understand the dynamics and functional guilds of microorganisms achieving syntrophic acetate-oxidation for methane production.
